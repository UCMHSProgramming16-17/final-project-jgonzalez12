So I'm planning on using the darksky api to be able to find the temperatures
that it's been on my birthday for the past 16 years at 3:00 pm in Elizabeth.
For my visual representations, I believe that I could make a scatterplot for the temperatures over the years,
but also a scatterplot of someone else's birthday to measure and compare the range 
of different temperatures over the past 16 years.
